# About Me

I am <strong>Tom Abbott</strong>. I've been coding since the 10th grade in the 80s, which means I've probably been doing this way too long.  But hey, anything you love doing is worth over-doing, right?  I got my start writing video games, with the grand dream that someday I would run my own game startup.

I've been working as a full-stack developer in enterprise software as a service (SAAS) for about fifteen years now. In my current job I develop in JavaScript, using React, Next.js, Node, and PostgreSQL.  I also code in C# and C++.

I have a Master's degree from Brigham Young University in Computer Science.  I did my thesis in complilers and computer languages.

I have also taught at the university level for about 8 years.  I taught web development at Utah Valley University, and I taught data structures and algorithms for Brigham Young University at the Salt Lake center.
